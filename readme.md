# TOP PRIORITY TODO's
 - port example for OCTO output!!!!
 - port / fix for your weird mapping!!! (maybe just make serpentine for simplicity!!)
 - make interface for brightness / time

# If you have time:
 - redo curtain with 1/2 the horizontal spacing (16 strips per pole?)  this would essentially make the curtain 20x6 instead of 40x5 (this limits the power / data length needed and makes conversion from simulation much simpler)
 - redo curtain for true serpentine layout (doubles the power runs which may actually help with dropout issues)

# Other nice to haves
 - re-add moddables
 - re-add hue shifting
 - re-add dynamics like center shifting?
 - re-add music reactivity
 - add knobs to play with!!! maybe just make separate module
