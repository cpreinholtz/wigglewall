# TOP PRIORITY TODO's
 - flip serpentine every other strip
    - figure out how serpentine defaults (same direction as rectangle??)
 - figure out pin numbering (use debug)
 - fix / redo the led mounting!!!!
 - re-add music reactivity

 
# If you have time:
 - make human knob interface for brightness / time
 - redo curtain with 1/2 the horizontal spacing (16 strips per pole?)  this would essentially make the curtain 20x6 instead of 40x5 (this limits the power / data length needed and makes conversion from simulation much simpler)
 - redo curtain for true serpentine layout (doubles the power runs which may actually help with dropout issues)

# Other nice to haves
 - re-add moddables
 - re-add dynamics like center shifting?
 - add knobs to play with!!! maybe just make separate module
